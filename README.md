# Project proposal
This challenge was proposed by the Mercado Livre in order to consult the external api and through a back end handle the data to be received by the front end

## Development
### Back end

Step 1: Go to api folder
```sh
$ cd meli-api
```

Step 2: Install the dependencies
```sh
$ yarn install
```
or
```sh
$ npm install
```

Step 3: Run the api
```sh
$ yarn dev
```
or
```sh
$ npm dev
```

For default api is run in localhost:8080 or go to [Api on Localhost](http://localhost:8080)

### Front end
Step 1: Go to front end folder
```sh
$ cd meli-frontend
```

Step 2: Install the dependencies
```sh
$ yarn install
```
or
```sh
$ npm install
```

Step 3: Run the api
```sh
$ yarn start
```
or
```sh
$ npm start
```

If the default browser does not take you directly to the address the project is running on, go to [React on Localhost](http://localhost:3000)
